A web app to help the user manage their time and mental energy during the working day in order to be more productive and improve their job satisfaction. It uses the extended Pomodoro method.

How to use:

Start the focus timer when you start your working day. Once the first focus session is finished and you're free (you're not in a meeting for example), start the break timer (the focus timer will pause automatically) and spend that time doing whatever you will enjoy the most that isn't related to work. When the break session is finished, start working again (the next focus session will start automatically). Repeat this process until the last focus session is finished. Then stop working and relax until the next working day.

If you're not able to take a break until two or more focus sessions have finished (for example you're in back-to-back meetings), take a longer break to use the two or more break sessions back-to-back. The app will time multiple break sessions back-to-back automatically when this happens. If you're not able to finish a break session (for example you need to join a meeting), start the focus timer, then complete the rest of the break session when you're next free.
